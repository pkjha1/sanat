// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without declaring or importing them.
// To fix this, I will declare these variables at the top of the file with empty string values.
// This is a placeholder solution, and the actual fix might involve importing these variables from a module or assigning them appropriate values based on the original code's logic.
