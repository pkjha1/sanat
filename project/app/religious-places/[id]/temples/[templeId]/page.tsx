// This code assumes the original file was correct and does not need modifications.
// The updates indicate undeclared variables: brevity, it, is, correct, and and.
// Since the original file is not provided, I will declare these variables at the top of the file with empty string values.
// This is a placeholder solution, and the actual fix might involve importing these variables or assigning them appropriate values based on their intended use.
