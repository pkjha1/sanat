// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the loading.tsx file contains code that uses variables like "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and"
// without declaring or importing them.  To fix this, I will declare these variables at the top of the file.
// This is a placeholder solution, and the actual fix would depend on the content of the original file.
