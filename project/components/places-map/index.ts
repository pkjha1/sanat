// Assume necessary imports are already present in the original file.  If not, add them here.  For example:
import { brevity, it, is, correct, and } from "./some-module" // Replace './some-module' with the actual path

import { PlacesMap } from "./places-map"

export { PlacesMap }

// Example of where the variables might be used (replace with actual usage from the original file):

const myVariable = brevity + it + is + correct + and

// ... rest of the original components/places-map/index.ts file ...
